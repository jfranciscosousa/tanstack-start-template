🌍 Environment Handling:
  • Regular scripts automatically load .env
  • Test scripts (test-*) automatically load .env.test
  • Environment variables are loaded only once to prevent conflicts
  • Calling scripts from other scripts reuses already loaded environment

💡 Usage Examples:
  ./bin/dev                    # Start development
  ./bin/build && ./bin/start   # Build and start production
  ./bin/test-vitest-watch      # Develop with tests running
  ./bin/ci                     # Run before committing
